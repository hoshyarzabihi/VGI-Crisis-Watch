# VGI-Crisis-Watch
VGI Crisis Watch is an interactive web application that enables citizens to report and monitor crisis events, environmental hazards, and damages in real-time. Built on the concept of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), this platform transforms ordinary citizens into active sensors for emergency response and environmental protection.
